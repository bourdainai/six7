## 🎮 The "6 or 7" Concept Explained

### What is the 6-7 Meme?

The internet phenomenon where people rate things as either "a 6 or a 7 out of 10" - acknowledging that most things in life are pretty good but not spectacular. It's become a cultural shorthand for honest, relatable assessment.

### How We Use It

1. **Prediction Game**: Before buying, guess if the item is a 6 or 7
2. **After Purchase**: Rate your actual experience (6 or 7)
3. **Correct Guess**: Earn credits + build streak
4. **Streaks**: 7-day streak = 3x rewards
5. **Pricing**: List at $X.67 or $X.76 for boosts
6. **Commission**: Platform randomly takes 6% or 7% (averages 6.5%)

### Why It Works

- **Binary Choice**: Simple decision, but meaningful
- **Meme Culture**: Culturally relevant and shareable  
- **Game Psychology**: Variable rewards are addictive
- **Social Proof**: Community ratings create trust
- **Viral Potential**: People share their streaks

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Can we ship faster than 2 weeks?
A: The MVP could be done in 1 week with a focused sprint, but 2 weeks allows for proper testing.

A: No! Start with MVP (prediction game), validate, then add features incrementally.

### Q: What if users don't engage with gamification?
A: We've built it as an optional enhancement. Core marketplace works fine without it.

### Q: How do we prevent gaming the system?
A: Multiple safeguards: rate limiting, fraud detection AI, human review, streak resets for abuse.

### Q: What's the minimum viable team?
A: 3-4 people can ship MVP: 2 engineers, 1 product/design, 1 growth/marketing.

### Q: When should we raise funding?
A: After MVP proves engagement (20%+ participation rate), before scaling needs outpace resources.
