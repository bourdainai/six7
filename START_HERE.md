## ⚡ The Core Concept: "6 or 7" Gamification

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   THE PREDICTION GAME                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. USER SEES LISTING
   └─> "Vintage Watch - $67.00"

2. PLATFORM ASKS: "Is this a 6 or a 7?"
   └─> User predicts before buying
   └─> 10-second timer for urgency

3. USER MAKES PURCHASE
   └─> Prediction locked in

4. USER RECEIVES ITEM
   └─> Platform asks: "So... was it a 6 or 7?"
   └─> User rates actual experience

5. REWARDS DISTRIBUTED
   ├─> Correct? ✅ Credits + Streak +1
   └─> Wrong? ❌ Streak resets (try again!)

6. ENGAGEMENT LOOPS
   ├─> Build 7-day streak = 3x rewards
   ├─> Climb leaderboards
   ├─> Unlock achievements
   └─> Share on social media
```

### Why This Works

1. **Binary Choice**: Simple but meaningful decision
2. **Meme Culture**: Culturally relevant, shareable
3. **Variable Rewards**: Psychology of gambling (legal!)
4. **Social Proof**: Community consensus builds trust
5. **Streak Mechanics**: Proven retention tool (Duolingo, Snapchat)
6. **Viral Potential**: "Just hit a 10-streak!" = social shares

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Over-engineer the MVP
```
Bad:  Build all 50 levels, 100 achievements, complex AI
Good: Ship prediction game, 1 leaderboard, basic stats
```

### ❌ Don't: Ignore core marketplace
```
Bad:  Focus 100% on gamification, neglect search/checkout
Good: Gamification enhances existing solid foundation
```

### ❌ Don't: Make it mandatory
```
Bad:  Force users to predict before buying
Good: Optional, enticing, rewarding if they choose
```

### ❌ Don't: Forget fraud prevention
```
Bad:  Trust all predictions, no rate limiting
Good: Anomaly detection, review suspicious patterns
```

### ❌ Don't: Launch without testing
```
Bad:  Ship to 100% of users on day 1
Good: Beta test with 10% → 50% → 100%
```
